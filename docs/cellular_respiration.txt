➜ Introduction:

 What is Cellular Respiration (C.R)?
Cellular respiration is the process by which biological fuels are oxidised in the presence of an
"inorganic electron acceptor" such as oxygen to produce large amounts of energy.
In shorter terms C.R is a neat way to get energy & coincides with photosynthesis.

 C.R & Cellular Energy
  - Animals use C.R to gain energy from food.
  - C.R transfers energy from organic compounds into useable energy (ATP).

 Metabolic Process

+= THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF C.R =+

   1. Aerobic
    - Requires Oxygen
    - More Efficient

   2. Anaerobic
    - This Stage Is Exucuted When No Oxygen Is Available

 The Stages of C.R

  1. Glycolysis
  2. Kerbs Cycle (K.C, & Oxygen is present)
  3. Electron Transport Chain (E.T.C)

+= C.R STAGES EXPLAINED =+

 1. Glycolysis
   - Breaks down glucose into "Pyruvate", then gains 2 ATP molecules
   P.1 - Add 2 ATPs to glucose resulting in a 6-carbon compounds
   P.2 - The 6-carbon compound is cut into 3-carbon compunds
   P.3 - 2 NADPH molecules are made and a "Phosphate" is added to each compound
   P.4 - Each of the 3-carbon compound is converted into a 3-carbon Pyruvate -> (Produces 4 ATP)

 2. K.C
   - Oxygen is present, Pyruvate then enters the mitochondria
   - Before the cycle even begins, Pyruvate is connected to a 2-carbon compound called "Acetyl"
   - Through a series of reactions NADH and FADH2 are produced
   - Much of the energy that was originally stored in glucose are stored in electro carriers

 3. E.T.C
   - NADH & FADH2 are used to donate electrons
   - Works similarly to the one in plants but...
     - Water donates electrons in plants
     - Water is made in animals
     - and NAPHD is in plants

Well thats it! I hope you read the blog about Photosynthesis first to know how connected the two are!
