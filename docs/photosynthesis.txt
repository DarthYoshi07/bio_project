➜ Introduction:

 What is Photosynthesis?
Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that,
through cellular respiration (explained in cellular_respiration.txt), can later be released to fuel the organism's activities.

 What happens during "Photosynthesis"?
Its more than just one thing that happens during Photosynthesis!
Photosynthesis is divided into multiple stages demonstrated here:

+= Stages of Photosynthesis =+
(Occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells)

 Stage 1: Energy is captured from sunlight..
 Stage 2: The Electron Transport Chain (E.T.C):
  Light energy is converted to chemical energy.
              (ATP -> NADHP)
 Stage 3: The Calvin Cycle (C.C):
APT and NADHP powers formation of organic compounds using CO2.
==============================================================
➜ A Deeper Explanation:

 How does a leaf absorb light?
You might want a deeper explantion on how energy is captured in the first stage of photosynthesis, well here is some more information:
    -   Light = Radiation / Pigments - Absorb Wavelenghts
    -   *Chlorophyll* is the pigment of photosynthesis:
        -   It absorbs blue, red; Then reflects green.

+= STAGES =+

1 - Thylakoids are embedded on the membrane of chloroplasts,
    and when light strikes thylakoids the light causes electrons to become somewhat "excited".
    Those electrons are then used to power the 2nd stage of photosynthesis which will be explained right now:

2 - Those electrons from stage 1 are then replaced by "splitting water".
    Then the "excited" electrons that leave the chloroplasts are used to create
    ATP & NADPH whom temporarily store energy, this is all supported by E.T.C.

3 - After the E.T.C it is the start of C.C.
    Plants will then use the energy that ATP & NADPH contain to build some
    useful high-energy compounds. The C.C uses APT & NADPH from the light
    dependent reactions to produce sugars.

Well thats it! Photosynthesis really is that simple, and just don't forget about cellular respiration!
